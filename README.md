# Go-Links

Keyword-based bookmarking within the search bar, initiated with the word *go*. Enables users to easily share any bookmarked websites (called *go-links*) by simply distributing the keyword it was marked with. All users require the accompanying Chrome extension; the link is below in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

This repository is the Flask backend that handles all of the HTTP GET and POST requests to Parse, the database containing all of the data. It also contains the files for local testing.
